# 👋 Hi, I'm Farhan Khan (Khandev)

### 🛠 Backend-Heavy Developer • 📱 Mobile Dev Lover (Flutter & React Native) • ⚡ Prototype Machine • 🚀 Builder of Big-Dream-Level Projects

If Amazon, SpaceX, and a hackathon had a baby — that would be the vibe I'm going for. I love creating fast, scalable backends, powerful APIs, and smooth mobile apps that feel **great**, respond **instantly**, and look **clean**.
